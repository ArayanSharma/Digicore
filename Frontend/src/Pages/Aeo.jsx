The website faced multiple technical SEO challenges, limited page-one keyword presence, and underutilised organic demand. Our focus was on fixing SEO foundations, improving keyword rankings, and building long-term authority across non-branded healthcare searches.

We implemented a Shopify-focused SEO strategy to expand keyword coverage, strengthen collection and product page rankings, and capture high-intent non-branded searches. As a result, Rizaries saw a significant rise in organic traffic and page-one keyword dominance, helping organic search become a consistent revenue driver."
