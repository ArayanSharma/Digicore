    "When The Moto Men approached us for Meta Ads, the challenge wasn’t lead volume – it was lead relevance. Many enquiries were coming from outside serviceable locations, impacting conversions and efficiency. The objective was to improve lead quality without increasing budgets or volumes. By implementing a location-first Meta Ads strategy and refining targeting and creatives, the campaigns began delivering only location-relevant, high-intent enquiries. As a result, lead quality improved significantly, conversions increased, and advertising spend became far more efficient with reduced wastage."  ]

Earlier campaigns faced lead relevancy issues, with many accidental or low-intent enquiries. We executed a customised Meta Ads strategy using reel and static formats, supported by a custom-built lead form to filter genuine franchise interest. Alongside paid campaigns, we managed complete social media marketing to strengthen brand recall and trust across target locations. The result was a significant improvement in enquiry quality, ensuring leads were relevant, intentional, and aligned with franchise expansion goals." ]

While enquiries were coming in, most lacked intent and did not convert. We restructured the Meta Ads strategy with a quality-first approach, refining targeting, messaging, and lead filtering to attract genuinely interested users instead of accidental submissions. The campaign delivered stronger lead relevancy, improved conversion rates, and a more cost-effective acquisition process, helping the brand connect with the right audience consistently." ]
